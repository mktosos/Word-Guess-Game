# Word-Guess-Game
This is the homework projet for the UC Davis Extension Coding BootCamp. It is an excercise in Javascript. Javascript event handling and logic were used as well as HTML and CSS.

The project is hangman-like word guess game based around types of fish. You get 9 wrong (hangman limbs) guesses per game.

Mike Taniguchi worked on this project. I was not able to sucessfully structure the code into functions which could be called on to repeat the core of the game once a game was won, while mantaining the global "WINS" count.
